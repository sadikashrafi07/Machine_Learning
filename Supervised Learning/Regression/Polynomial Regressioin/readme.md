Polynomial regression is a type of regression analysis used in statistics to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Unlike simple linear regression, which fits a straight line to the data, polynomial regression uses a polynomial equation to capture more complex patterns(non-linear relationship) in the data.

In simple terms, a polynomial equation looks like this:

\[ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \beta_2X^2 + \beta_3X^3 + \ldots + \beta_nX^n + \varepsilon \]

Here:
- \( Y \) is the dependent variable.
- \( X \) is the independent variable.
- \( \beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_n \) are the coefficients.
- \( \varepsilon \) represents the error term.

The key feature of polynomial regression is that it allows for the inclusion of higher-order terms (\(X^2, X^3, \ldots, X^n\)) in addition to the linear term (\(X\)). This enables the model to better fit curves and capture more intricate relationships in the data.

For example, in a quadratic (degree-2) polynomial regression, the equation would be:

\[ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \beta_2X^2 + \varepsilon \]

In a cubic (degree-3) polynomial regression:

\[ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \beta_2X^2 + \beta_3X^3 + \varepsilon \]

And so on. The degree of the polynomial (\(n\)) determines how flexible or complex the model can be. It's important to note that higher-degree polynomials can lead to overfitting, where the model fits the training data too closely and performs poorly on new, unseen data. Therefore, selecting an appropriate degree is crucial in polynomial regression.
